## HOME MARKET
[Country] · [Category] · [Stage of brand e.g. D2C scaling, traditional FMCG, challenger]

## MARKET SIZE & SHARE
State each as a single punchy line:
- Category TAM: [₹/$ figure, year, source]
- Growth rate: [CAGR % or YoY %]
- ${company} position: [share % or rank + basis]
- #1 player: [name, share %] | #2: [name, share %] | #3: [name, share %]
- Key sub-segment (if relevant): [size + why it matters]

## DISTRIBUTION HEALTH
Critical benchmarks for ${company}:
- **Numeric Distribution**: % of relevant outlets stocking ≥1 ${company} SKU. Compare against category leader.
- **Weighted Distribution**: % of category sales value in stores that stock ${company}. Quality over quantity.
- If data unavailable, estimate based on outlet count and compare to #1 player's known distribution.
Format: Numeric Distribution: [X%] (Target >[Y%]) · Weighted Distribution: [A%] (Target >[B%])
Active selling outlets vs stocked outlets gap = silent revenue leak.

## DARK DATA PATTERNS
3 non-obvious signals the data reveals but conventional wisdom misses.
Format each as:
**[Pattern Name]** — [One sentence: what the data shows.] [One sentence: why most brands miss it.] → GTM implication: [One specific action this unlocks.]

## MARKET TAILWINDS
2 macro forces actively working in ${company}'s favour RIGHT NOW.
Format: **[Tailwind]** — [Specific evidence in this market] → How to exploit it: [One concrete move]

## HIDDEN FRICTION POINTS
2 structural barriers specific to this market that founders consistently underestimate.
Format: **[Friction]** — [Why it's harder than it looks] → The only way through: [Specific approach]

## INTELLIGENCE VERDICT
One paragraph, 3 sentences max. The single most important thing the market data is telling this brand. Written for a founder who has 30 seconds. Start with the most important word.`,

    competitive:
`You are a CPG competitive intelligence analyst.
Company: "${company}". Context: "${c}".
${COUNTRY_INSTRUCTION}

Your ONLY job: map the competitive landscape. No segment analysis — separate agent handles that.

## HOME MARKET CONFIRMED
[Country] — all data below is this market only.

## NATIONAL COMPETITIVE MAP
Axes: choose the 2 that most determine purchase decisions in this category (NOT generic price/quality).
Format as a clear 2x2. Each competitor entry: [Brand] — [one-line positioning rationale] — [one hard data point: share %, revenue, outlet count, or SKU count]

## REGIONAL COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS
Which players dominate which regions and WHY. Name specific regions, name the brands, state the mechanism (e.g. "Haldiram's owns North India through 40-year kirana relationships, not price"). Include share or distribution figures where available.

## COMPETITOR COMPARISON TABLE
| Brand | Revenue/Size | Mkt Share | Retail Reach | Distribution | Achilles Heel |
Format each row with actual figures or best estimates. Label estimates as "(est.)".

## COMPETITIVE DISTRIBUTION GAP
Compare ${company}'s distribution health to category leader:
- Numeric distribution gap: [Leader X%] vs [${company} Y%] = [Z] point gap
- Weighted distribution gap: [Leader A%] vs [${company} B%] = [C] point difference
This gap represents structural disadvantage or opportunity depending on efficiency.

## COMPETITIVE VULNERABILITIES
2 specific, exploitable weaknesses — one each from the top 2 competitors.
Format: **[Competitor]** — [The specific weakness — be precise, not generic] → The opening this creates for ${company}: [Exact GTM move]

## POSITIONING VERDICT
One sentence. The most defensible, least contested position ${company} can claim. Make it specific enough to reject — "premium natural snacks" is too vague. "The only snack brand built for post-gym recovery in metro India" is a verdict.`,

## CHANNEL MIX BENCHMARK
The 6 channels that matter most for this category in this country.
| Channel | Typical Spend % | Effectiveness | Trend | Brand doing it best here |
Be specific: "Modern Trade" not "retail", "Meta Reels + influencer seeding" not "social media".

## OVER-INDEXED CHANNELS
2 channels where this brand is almost certainly spending more than the return justifies.
Format: **[Channel]** — [Why the ROI has degraded: specific mechanism] — [What the wasted spend looks like in ₹/$ terms] → Redirect to: [specific alternative]

## UNDER-INDEXED CHANNELS
2 channels with the highest untapped ROI for this brand specifically.
Format: **[Channel]** — [Why this is underexploited: category proof point] — [What good looks like: specific brand example in this market] → Entry move: [First 30-day action]

## HOME MARKET CONFIRMED
[Country] — all consumer data from this market only.

## CURRENT DOMINANT SEGMENT
Who this brand is over-indexed on — stated as a precise profile, not a vague archetype.
- Demographics: [age range, gender split, income bracket, geographies]
- Psychographics: [2-3 specific values, what they watch/read, why they chose this brand]
- The ceiling: [Specific reason this segment cannot sustain growth — market size limit, CAC inflation, saturation signal]

## WHITESPACE SEGMENTS
3 underserved segments. For each, follow this exact format:

**[Segment Name]**
Who: [Tight demographic + psychographic — 2 sentences]
Size signal: [Proxy metric with source — search volume, adjacent category size, demographic count]
Why unserved: [The specific reason no brand has cracked this — not "lack of awareness", something structural]
GTM hook: [The one message or product tweak that unlocks them — specific enough to write an ad for]
Acquisition channel: [The specific channel in this market where they're reachable]

## HIGHEST-VALUE PIVOT SEGMENT
State a clear choice and defend it in 3 sentences:
1. [Why this segment over the other two — size + accessibility + strategic fit]
2. [The first 90-day acquisition motion — specific enough to execute]
3. [The metric that confirms it's working — with a threshold number]

## SEGMENT VERDICT
One paragraph. The segment bet that most changes ${company}'s growth trajectory in this market. Written like advice to a founder, not a consulting report.`,

    pivot:
`You are Harsha Belavady, senior CPG strategy advisor. Full intelligence sprint completed on "${company}".

${SHARPNESS_RULES}

You have read the market signals, competitive landscape, channel audit, and segment analysis. Now synthesise them into one coherent strategic pivot. Be an advisor, not a summariser — challenge comfortable assumptions, make hard calls.

## THE PIVOT THESIS
One sentence. Specific enough that a competitor could read it and know exactly what you're doing. Start with "${company} must..."

## WHAT TO STOP
2 things. Format: **[Activity]** — [Why stopping this now is the right call — one honest sentence]

## WHAT TO START
3 new GTM motions. Format:
**[Motion]** — [Why now, not later: the specific window of opportunity] → Target metric: [What success looks like in 90 days]

## WHAT TO ACCELERATE
1 thing already working. Format: **[Activity]** — [Why doubling down beats starting something new] → Double from [X] to [Y] by [date]

## 90-DAY ROADMAP
Month 1 — Foundation: [3 specific actions, each ownable by one person]
Month 2 — Activation: [3 specific actions, each with a measurable output]
Month 3 — Proof: [3 specific actions + the 2 metrics that determine if the pivot is working]

## PIVOT RISK
**The real risk** (not generic execution risk): [One specific thing that could make this pivot fail] → Mitigation: [One specific action to reduce it]

## STRATEGIC CONVICTION
3 sentences directly to the founder. Sentence 1: the hardest truth from this analysis. Sentence 2: what this pivot requires them to let go of. Sentence 3: why the timing is right now.`,

    kpis:
`You are a CPG strategy advisor designing the measurement system for ${company}'s GTM pivot.
${sc}
${SHARPNESS_RULES}

## NORTH STAR METRIC
[Metric name] — [Definition in one sentence] — [Why this one, not revenue or orders: the strategic logic] — Target: [Specific number within 6 months]

## WEEKLY PULSE (5 metrics)
Monday 9AM review, 20 minutes, founder + channel leads.
| Metric | Definition | Healthy Range | Red Flag Threshold | Response if Red |
Make these leading indicators, not lagging. Revenue is a lagging indicator. CAC by channel is leading.

## MONTHLY BUSINESS REVIEW (4 metrics)
| Metric | What It Reveals | How to Calculate | Decision It Drives |
These should test whether the pivot thesis is holding.

## QUARTERLY STRATEGIC METRICS (3 metrics)
| Metric | Confirms Thesis If... | Reconsider Pivot If... |
These are the bet-level metrics. If they move the wrong way, the strategy changes.

## OPERATING CADENCE
Weekly: [Who, duration, 3 agenda items, one decision made]
Monthly: [Who, duration, 3 agenda items, one decision made]
Quarterly: [Who, duration, 3 agenda items, one decision made]`,

    narrative:
`You are Harsha Belavady, CPG strategy advisor. Full sprint on "${company}" complete.

${SHARPNESS_RULES}

Write the board/investor narrative. This is the document that gets read in a 3-minute slot before the Q&A. Every sentence must earn its place.

## SITUATION
2 sentences. State the business position as a fact, not a story. Include one number.

## COMPLICATION
2 sentences. The strategic tension the data revealed. This should be uncomfortable — if the board already knows it, sharpen it.

## THE PIVOT
3 sentences. What changes, why now, what it requires. The logic should be airtight.

## THE OPPORTUNITY
2 sentences. What becomes possible if the pivot works. Anchor to a market signal, not aspiration.

## WHAT WE NEED
1-2 sentences. The specific decision or resource from this room. Be direct — don't soften the ask.

## CONVICTION
2 sentences. The advisory POV. Why this advisor believes this is the right move. No hedging.`,

  signals: `## HOME MARKET
India · Salty Snacks (Extruded/Bridges sub-segment) · Challenger scaling in modern trade

## MARKET SIZE & SHARE
- TAM: ₹42,000 Cr (India salty snacks, Nielsen IQ 2024)
- Growth: 12% CAGR (Nielsen IQ India FMCG 2024)
- Bingo position: #2 in bridges/extruded, ~14% share (est. Nielsen IQ 2023)
- #1 Haldiram's ~28% | #2 Bingo ~14% | #3 Kurkure (PepsiCo) ~18%
- Extruded sub-segment: ₹8,200 Cr growing 16% YoY

## DARK DATA PATTERNS
**The Kirana Blind Spot** — Modern trade is only 18% of India snack sales yet captures ~80% of Bingo's marketing attention. Rural/semi-urban kiranas move 4x volume per SKU at near-zero marketing cost. → GTM implication: Redirect 20% of MT activation budget to kirana push in Tier 2/3 using ITC's existing 6M outlet network.

**Post-School Rush Timing** — 68% of impulse snack purchases happen 3–6 PM (IRI India shopper study 2023). Bingo's digital ads peak 9–11 AM. → GTM implication: Shift Meta/YouTube delivery to 2:30–6 PM; negotiate end-cap placement at kiranas near schools in top 20 cities.

**Protein Anxiety Creep** — 34% of urban Indian snack buyers 18–35 now check nutrition labels (BCG-CII 2024), up from 19% in 2021. No bridge snack brand owns a nutrition claim. → GTM implication: Launch "Bingo Protein+" variant at ₹20, gym-adjacent retail, first-mover in bridges nutrition positioning.

## MARKET TAILWINDS
**Quick Commerce Velocity** — Blinkit/Swiggy Instamart/Zepto processed 2.1 Cr snack orders Dec 2024, +67% YoY (Redseer QComm 2024). Impulse snacks are #1 QComm FMCG category by order frequency. → Exploit: Negotiate exclusive QComm bundle packs at ₹49/₹99; QComm-native SKU sizes not currently in Bingo's range.

**Premiumisation in Tier 1** — ₹20+ SKUs growing 23% vs 8% for ₹10 SKUs (Nielsen IQ 2024). Metro consumers actively trading up. → Exploit: Accelerate premium variants exclusively in MT and QComm before Haldiram's fills the space.

## HIDDEN FRICTION POINTS
**ITC Distribution Dependency** — Bingo benefits from ITC's 6M outlet network but ITC field force prioritises cigarettes and Aashirvaad. Effective active Bingo distribution is closer to 2.8M outlets (est.). → Only way through: Dedicated Bingo field activation team of 200 reps focused purely on snack shelf share in top 100 cities.

**Flavour Fatigue at ₹10** — The ₹10 tier has 40+ SKUs across 6 brands. Bingo ₹10 repeat purchase rates plateaued at 31% (est. trade data). → Only way through: Rationalise to 3 hero ₹10 SKUs; use freed shelf space to push ₹20 variants with higher margin and repeat rates.

## INTELLIGENCE VERDICT
The Indian salty snacks market is bifurcating into a high-volume margin-thin ₹10 tier and a fast-growing ₹20–₹30 premiumisation tier. Bingo is structurally strong in the former but has a 12–18 month window to establish ₹20 leadership before Haldiram's and PepsiCo redirect investment there. Launch a credible ₹20 premium SKU with a nutrition hook through QComm and modern trade within 90 days.`,

  competitive: `## HOME MARKET CONFIRMED
India — all data scoped to Indian salty snacks market.

## NATIONAL COMPETITIVE MAP
Axes: Price (Mass ₹5–10 vs Premium ₹20+) × Distribution (Kirana-first vs MT/Digital-first)

KIRANA-FIRST | Haldiram's ₹10 [28%, 4M outlets] | Parle Hippo [niche]
MASS ←——————————————————————————————————————→ PREMIUM
MT/DIGITAL   | Kurkure PepsiCo [18%]            | BINGO ITC [14%, MT-indexed]

## REGIONAL COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS
**North India:** Haldiram's 35%+ share via 40-year kirana relationships in UP/Bihar/Delhi. Bingo is #3.
**West India:** PepsiCo strongest in Maharashtra/Gujarat through MT. Bingo under 10% share (est.).
**South India:** Most fragmented. Local players 30%+ combined. Bingo #2. Best region for premium push.
**East India:** Bingo's home turf (ITC HQ Kolkata). Highest share ~22%. Deepest kirana penetration.

## COMPETITOR COMPARISON TABLE
| Brand | Revenue | Mkt Share | Retail Reach | Distribution | Achilles Heel |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Haldiram's | ₹12,000 Cr | 28% | 4M+ outlets | Own fleet | No D2C, weak digital |
| Kurkure | ₹3,200 Cr (est.) | 18% | 3.5M | PepsiCo direct | Single SKU dependency |
| Bingo (ITC) | ₹2,800 Cr (est.) | 14% | 2.8M active | ITC network | MT-indexed, weak ₹20 tier |
| Balaji Wafers | ₹1,800 Cr | 8% | 1.2M (West) | Regional only | Geography-limited |
| Parle Products | ₹900 Cr | 5% | 2M | Biscuit-led | Snacks not core focus |

## COMPETITIVE VULNERABILITIES
**Haldiram's** — Zero QComm infrastructure: no dedicated quick commerce strategy, packaging not optimised for impulse single-serve. Bingo's ₹10/₹20 SKUs are purpose-built for QComm. → Push exclusive QComm bundles and dark-store placement before Haldiram's catches up.

**Kurkure** — 60% of revenue from one SKU (Masala Munch). PepsiCo global restructuring has slowed India NPD. → Launch direct competitive SKU at ₹2 lower price, better nutrition label, target Kurkure's MT shelf slots with aggressive trade margins.

## POSITIONING VERDICT
Bingo should claim: "The only snack brand engineered for how India snacks in 2025 — QComm-native, ₹20 premium, with nutrition you can read."`,

  channels: `## HOME MARKET CONFIRMED
India — Indian retail and media landscape only.

## CHANNEL MIX BENCHMARK
| Channel | Spend % | Effectiveness | Trend | Best Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| General Trade (Kirana) | 35% | High | Stable | Haldiram's — owns kirana via trade margins |
| Modern Trade | 20% | Medium | Growing | Kurkure — end-cap dominance in D-Mart |
| Quick Commerce | 8% | Very High | +67% YoY | Lay's — QComm-exclusive pack sizes |
| Digital (Meta/YouTube) | 18% | Medium | Plateauing | Mamaearth — influencer + performance mix |
| TV/OOH | 14% | Medium | Declining | Haldiram's — mass brand building |
| Sampling/Activation | 5% | High | Underused | Red Bull — transit and event sampling |

## OVER-INDEXED CHANNELS
**Digital at ~18%** — CPM in India food/snacks rose 34% in 2024 (Meta India). Bingo's demo has migrated to Reels/Shorts but ad recall is 12% vs 34% for TV. ₹1 digital now drives ₹2.1 revenue vs ₹3.4 in 2022. → Redirect 6% of digital budget to QComm sponsored placements where purchase intent is immediate.

**TV/OOH at ~14%** — Bingo is already at 67% aided awareness nationally. Incremental TV drives less than 0.5% awareness uplift per ₹10 Cr spend (BARC India 2024). → Cut TV by ₹15–20 Cr; reallocate to in-store activation and QComm.

## UNDER-INDEXED CHANNELS
**Quick Commerce at ~8%** — Growing 67% YoY. Average QComm snack basket is ₹180 vs ₹28 in kirana — 6x revenue per transaction. No QComm-native strategy exists for Bingo. → List 4 QComm-exclusive SKUs (₹49 sharing, ₹99 variety box), negotiate top-3 search placement on Blinkit in 10 cities within 60 days.

**Sampling/Activation at ~5%** — Transit sampling delivers 23% trial-to-repeat in snacks (Nielsen India 2023), highest of any channel. Bingo has minimal sampling presence. → Deploy 50 sampling activations/month at metro stations in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru. Cost ~₹80L/month for 2.1L trials and 48K new repeat buyers.

## CHANNEL REALLOCATION
"Reduce TV from ~14% to ~8% (save ₹18 Cr) + digital from ~18% to ~14% (save ₹8 Cr). Reallocate ₹26 Cr to QComm at 14% (+₹16 Cr) and Sampling at 10% (+₹10 Cr). QComm revenue share grows from 6% to 14% within 9 months."

## CHANNEL AUDIT VERDICT
Negotiate top-3 QComm search placement on Blinkit for "chips" and "snacks" in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru within 30 days — captures highest-intent snack buyers at moment of purchase.`,

  segments: `## HOME MARKET CONFIRMED
India — all consumer data from Indian market only.

## CURRENT DOMINANT SEGMENT
Demographics: 15–24 yr males, SEC B/C, Tier 1/2 cities, students and early earners
Psychographics: Value-seekers, cricket/gaming, peer-influenced impulse purchase at kirana near college
The ceiling: Aided awareness already 78% among 15–24 males. CAC rising 20% YoY. This segment is maxed out at ~₹3,200 Cr TAM with 18% share — growth requires expanding the tent.

## WHITESPACE SEGMENTS

**The Office Desk Snacker**
Who: 25–35 yr professionals, SEC A/B, metros, WFH/hybrid. Snack 2–3x/day at desk. Want portion control without guilt.
Size signal: "Healthy office snacks India" search volume +340% since 2022 (Google Trends). Too Yumm grew 40%+ targeting adjacent wellness occasion.
Why unserved: All bridge brands position on indulgence — no brand owns the "smart snacking at work" occasion.
GTM hook: "Bingo Lite — Same bold flavour, 30% fewer calories. For when work doesn't stop but the guilt does." ₹20 single-serve.
Channel: LinkedIn + Instagram Reels targeting 25–34 professionals; Swiggy Instamart 11AM–2PM office slot; corporate pantry tie-ups WeWork/Awfis.

**The Health-Conscious Mother**
Who: 30–45 yr urban mothers, SEC A, metros/Tier 1. Buys snacks for children 6–14. Reads labels. Rejected Kurkure for artificial colours.
Size signal: India kids' healthy snack segment ₹2,800 Cr, +19% YoY (Redseer 2024). Slurrp Farm raised ₹100 Cr+ on this segment.
Why unserved: No mass snack brand at ₹10–₹20 has made a credible clean-label claim. Healthy kids' snacks are either too expensive (₹50+) or taste bad.
GTM hook: "Bingo Junior — Real ingredients, no artificial colours. ₹15. Passes the mum test."
Channel: Mommy influencers 5K–50K Instagram. BigBasket/Zepto family grocery bundles. MT kids' aisle positioning.

**The Bharat Upgrader**
Who: 22–35 yr first-generation earners in Tier 2/3 cities (Patna, Indore, Surat). Rising income, aspiring lifestyle. Trading up in smartphones and clothing but no snack brand has spoken to them.
Size signal: Tier 2/3 packaged food spend growing 18% vs 11% metros (BCG-CII 2024). 60% of India's population, only 35% of Bingo's revenue.
Why unserved: Premium snack brands are distributed metro-first. Tier 2/3 gets stale stock and limited flavour variety.
GTM hook: "Bingo Select — New flavours, first in your city." Limited-edition regional flavours (Lucknow Chaat, Surat Locho) at ₹20.
Channel: Regional YouTube creators in Hindi/regional languages. WhatsApp Commerce via ITC's rural network. Kirana visibility push in top 200 Tier 2/3 cities.

## HIGHEST-VALUE PIVOT SEGMENT
1. Office Desk Snacker wins: 80M+ addressable professionals, ₹20 ASP vs ₹10, reachable via QComm + professional digital at lower CAC, zero competition from Haldiram's or Kurkure.
2. Launch Bingo Lite exclusively on Blinkit/Swiggy Instamart and corporate cafeterias in Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi. Seed 50 LinkedIn micro-influencers (10K–100K followers). No TV, no mass digital.
3. Confirming metric: 15% repeat purchase rate among office-segment first-time buyers within 60 days.

## SEGMENT VERDICT
The Office Desk Snacker is Bingo's highest-conviction next bet — large (80M+), unserved, reachable through channels where Bingo is under-indexed, and it justifies the ₹20 price point unlocking margin expansion and premiumisation. The window is 12–18 months before a funded competitor fills it.`,

  pivot: `## THE PIVOT THESIS
Bingo must pivot from mass impulse snack competing on price and distribution to a QComm-native ₹20 brand owning the office snacking occasion — this is where India's spending is going, where no competitor is positioned, and where ITC's infrastructure gives Bingo an 18-month head start.

## WHAT TO STOP
**Defending the ₹10 impulse tier at all costs** — High volume, declining margins, rising CAC, price-switching customers. Maintain distribution but stop incremental investment in ₹10 SKU innovation and promotion.
**Spray-and-pray TV and national digital** — At 67% aided awareness, incremental mass media returns under 0.5% awareness uplift per ₹10 Cr. Every rupee here is wasted.

## WHAT TO START
**QComm-native SKU strategy** — 4 QComm-exclusive formats (₹49 sharing, ₹99 variety box, ₹20 Lite, ₹35 premium) built for Blinkit/Zepto basket sizes. → Target: 14% of Bingo revenue from QComm within 9 months (from ~6%).
**Office occasion campaign** — "Bingo Lite" as the smart desk snack. 50 LinkedIn micro-influencers, corporate cafeteria tie-ups in 5 cities, Swiggy Instamart 11AM–2PM slot. → Target: 15% repeat purchase among office-segment first-time buyers in 60 days.
**Regional flavour drops Tier 2/3** — Limited-edition city-specific flavours via ITC's kirana network. Create scarcity and tastemaker effect. → Target: 40% sell-through within 30 days in pilot cities.

## WHAT TO ACCELERATE
**ITC's Tier 2/3 distribution** — ITC has India's deepest Tier 2/3 reach. Bingo is not maximising it for premium SKUs. → Double premium SKUs available Tier 2/3 from 4 to 8, double active premium outlets from 400K to 800K by Month 9.

## 90-DAY ROADMAP
Month 1 — Foundation: Brief packaging agency for Bingo Lite (clean label, office positioning) | Negotiate QComm tier-1 placement with Blinkit and Zepto in 3 cities | Identify 50 LinkedIn micro-influencers for office snacking campaign
Month 2 — Activation: Launch Bingo Lite exclusively on QComm in 3 cities | Deploy corporate cafeteria sampling in 20 WeWork/Awfis locations Delhi + Bengaluru | Launch Lucknow Chaat flavour drop in UP/Bihar Tier 2 cities via ITC
Month 3 — Proof: Expand Bingo Lite to 5 more cities on QComm data | Present regional flavour results to ITC leadership | Review office repeat rate vs 15% threshold
Success metrics: QComm revenue share 9% | Bingo Lite repeat rate 15% | ₹20+ SKU portfolio share 22% (from 14%)

## PIVOT RISK
**The real risk — ITC internal prioritisation**: Bingo is one of 25+ ITC FMCG brands. This pivot competes for ITC resources with Aashirvaad and Sunfeast, both larger P&L contributors. → Mitigation: Build as self-funded pilot using Bingo's own A&P reallocation, with 90-day proof point triggering ITC board approval for additional resource.

## STRATEGIC CONVICTION
The hardest truth: Bingo's biggest threat is not Haldiram's or Kurkure — it is the company's own comfort with being a strong #2 in a growing market, which makes the internal case for disrupting the ₹10 playbook feel unnecessary. This pivot requires letting go of volume as the primary success metric and accepting that fewer ₹20 transactions are strategically more valuable than more ₹10 ones. The timing is right because QComm is still in its land-grab phase and Haldiram's 18-month digital infrastructure gap is the clearest competitive window Bingo will have this decade.`,

  kpis: `## NORTH STAR METRIC
**₹20+ SKU Revenue Share** — percentage of total Bingo revenue from SKUs priced ₹20 and above. Target: 28% in 6 months (from ~14%). Why this over total revenue: it is the single metric that tracks whether premiumisation is structurally working and cannot be gamed by volume discounting.

## WEEKLY PULSE (5 metrics)
| Metric | Definition | Healthy Range | Red Flag | Response |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| QComm Daily Orders | Units/day across Blinkit + Zepto + Instamart | >2,400 by Wk4 | <1,200 | Escalate placement rank, review pricing |
| Bingo Lite Repeat Rate | First-time buyers reordering within 14 days | >12% | <6% | Review flavour, occasion messaging |
| Office Influencer CTR | Avg click-through on LinkedIn campaign posts | >2.8% | <1.2% | Refresh creative, re-brief influencers |
| ₹20 SKU Distribution | Active outlets stocking ≥1 ₹20 SKU | >480K by Wk8 | <320K | Accelerate Tier 2/3 field push |
| Trade Margin Compliance | % outlets receiving agreed margin on ₹20 SKUs | >92% | <80% | Audit top 5 distributors immediately |

## MONTHLY BUSINESS REVIEW (4 metrics)
| Metric | What It Reveals | How to Calculate | Decision It Drives |
|---|---|---|---|
| QComm Revenue Share | Whether QComm is becoming structural | QComm revenue ÷ total Bingo revenue | Increase/decrease QComm SKU investment |
| Premium SKU Gross Margin | Whether ₹20 tier is delivering the margin thesis | (Revenue - COGS) ÷ Revenue for ₹20+ SKUs | Pricing and formulation decisions |
| Office Segment CAC | Whether office channel is efficient vs mass digital | Total office campaign spend ÷ new repeat buyers | Channel reallocation decisions |
| Tier 2/3 Premium Velocity | Whether Bharat Upgrader segment is responding | ₹20+ SKU units/active outlet in T2/3 vs T1 | Regional investment decisions |

## QUARTERLY STRATEGIC METRICS
| Metric | Thesis Confirmed If... | Reconsider Pivot If... |
|---|---|---|
| ₹20+ Revenue Share | Reaches 22%+ | Still below 16% at Month 6 |
| QComm Revenue Share | Reaches 12%+ | Below 8% at Month 9 |
| Office Repeat Rate | 15%+ sustained for 8 weeks | Below 10% after 3 months |

  narrative: `## SITUATION
Bingo holds a strong #2 position in India's ₹42,000 Cr salty snacks market with ~14% share, built on ITC's unmatched 2.8M-outlet distribution and a loyal 15–24 male core. The business generates an estimated ₹2,800 Cr in annual revenue but 86% of that comes from the ₹10 impulse tier where margins are thin and CAC is rising 20% YoY.

## COMPLICATION
The ₹10 tier is becoming a trap: 40+ SKUs across 6 brands have commoditised the space, repeat rates have plateaued at 31%, and every marketing rupee is fighting for the same 15–24 male audience with every other snack brand. Meanwhile the ₹20+ premium tier is growing at 23% YoY and Bingo has only 14% of its own portfolio there — Haldiram's and PepsiCo will not ignore this for long.

## THE PIVOT
Bingo must reposition as a QComm-native, ₹20 premium brand owning the office snacking occasion — launching Bingo Lite on Blinkit/Zepto exclusively, seeding LinkedIn micro-influencers, and using ITC's Tier 2/3 network for regional flavour drops that make the brand feel premium and local simultaneously. This is not a brand reinvention; it is a price tier migration that Bingo's flavour DNA fully supports.

## THE OPPORTUNITY
If the ₹20 tier reaches 28% of Bingo's revenue within 6 months — from 14% today — it adds approximately ₹400 Cr in higher-margin revenue and establishes Bingo as the defining snack brand of India's professionalising, premiumising middle class before any competitor has a credible claim in that space.

## WHAT WE NEED
A decision today to reallocate ₹26 Cr from TV and underperforming digital to QComm placement and office-occasion activation — this is not incremental budget, it is a reallocation with a 90-day proof point built in.

## CONVICTION
This advisor's view: the data is unambiguous that QComm and the office snacking occasion are structurally underserved by every snack brand in India, and Bingo has ITC's infrastructure to move faster than any D2C challenger could. The risk is not whether the market exists — it does — the risk is whether ITC's internal prioritisation allows Bingo to move at startup speed. Solve that internally, and this is the right pivot at the right time.`,
